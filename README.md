Tool to remove common shortcut problem on flash drives

WARNING :

This tool modifies the infected drives in order to remove those
pesky "shortcuts". In the process, unintended data loss might
occur. In these occurences, I'm NOT to be held responsible.

In order for the tool to work, it requires Administrator rights.
This is required for the following modifications :

  - Detecting hidden, system and other various files on the
    infected drive.
  - Deleting those files.
  - Creating hidden system file that *probably* prevents the
    problem to happen again.

Run this tool at your own risk!

Post mortem:
- Typing drive letter doesn't work

I might update this when I got the time
